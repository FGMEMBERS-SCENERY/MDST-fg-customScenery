MDST - Cibao Airport 
----------------------------------------

How to install the scenery?

Copy or unzip all files and put it in the following directory:
Flightgear -> data -> Scenery -> Objects -> w080n10 -> w071n19

Put the folder named 'MDST' without unzipping to the final directory!
Be sure that you replace the stg-file named "1792859" otherwise it won't work later.
If there are question or problems you can mail me in Lukas' Flightgear Hangar.
